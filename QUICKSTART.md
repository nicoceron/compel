2. **Start with weekly check-ins** - Daily can be overwhelming
3. **Be specific with goals** - "Exercise 3x/week" is better than "Get fit"
4. **Use the description** - Add details about what counts as success
5. **Pick meaningful stakes** - Choose a recipient that motivates you

## ðŸŽ‰ You're All Set!

Start creating goals and staying accountable! Remember:
- Set realistic goals
